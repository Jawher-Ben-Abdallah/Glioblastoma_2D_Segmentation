# Glioblastoma 2D Segmentation 

The goal of this project is to create a computationally inexpensive 2D pipeline for glioblastoma brain tumor segmentation.
In the showcase Notebook, we will detail the different approaches taken to reduce the computational overhead often encountered when working with 3D medical data.
